# Employee-Attrition-Analysis
This project is a machine learning classification problem. The objective of this project was to predict the rate of employee attrition based on different features.
I applied three classification algorithms (Logistics, XGBoost & Random Forest). But I got high accuracy score about 85.37 using random Forest.
